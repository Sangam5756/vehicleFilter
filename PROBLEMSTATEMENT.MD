Hi

Here you go

 

Attached is a json file.

Populate the given vehicle data in the Table in paginated form.

As a user I should be able to search in the data using a Search affordance in the presentation layer.

The page should be responsive and UI/UX should scale and change as per the screen form factor.  Host the page on any hosting platform.

 

Programming language/framework to use.

- Nextjs for server side rendering

- Reactjs for frontend framework

- Ant design library for ReactJs UI components

- Redux toolkit for store and side effects management

- Typescript preferred as programming language

- Tailwind for CSS

 

Usage of native html tags should be minimum and entire UI should be managed using Ant design library

The app should load page as server side rendered page.

The search/pagination should work on client side.

Consider styling, tooltips, labels and anything that you think might be important for a rich visual experience.

Examine the dataset and consider what types of questions you might want to ask of the data

Consider how you would use the search affordance to perform combination queries like the model type and brand of vehicle etc.

 

Accompany your submission with a written summary of the approach that you used to tackle this assignment.
